      <h2>I goofed when printing these Magnetic HTML tiles and now just want to get rid of them. <a href="http://bit.ly/magHTMLPaypal">Want one for $5?</a></h2>
      <p>I spent $5000 for 1000. I'm a 26-year-old newlywed, so that was a lot of money. I planned on selling them for $10, and made this neat interactive site &mdash; try clicking and dragging some of the tiles to the left.</p>
      <p>Then I found two typos, both of which are totally my fault.</p>
      <figure class="photoSwap">
        <img src="sheet.jpg" alt="Looks OK..." />
        <img src="circled.png" alt="Oh, wait" />
        <figcaption>It's <code>&amp;trade;</code>, not <code>&amp;tradem;</code>, and comments always have at least two hyphens at the start and end.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The tiles are pretty cool, regardless. Almost no-one would notice.</p>
      <p>But it still means that I'm probably stuck selling them myself, instead of hoping for ThinkGeek or whoever to retail them.</p>
      <p>So they're stacked up in boxes along the wall of our bedroom. My wife wants them out of the apartment.</p>
      <p>It would be really nice if you'd <a href="http://bit.ly/magHTMLPaypal">buy one for $5</a> &mdash; what they cost me &mdash; plus shipping.</p>
      <p>They'd make great Christmanukkah presents for the Internet nerds you know.</p>
